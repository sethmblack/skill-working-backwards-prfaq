# Working Backwards PR/FAQ

Structure new product or feature thinking by writing the press release and FAQ before building anything. This forces customer-centric clarity and kills bad ideas before investment.

---

## When to Use

- User proposes a new product or feature idea
- Team is about to start building without clarity
- Request for "working backwards" analysis
- Product/feature planning discussions
- Evaluating whether an idea is worth pursuing

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| concept | Yes | The product, feature, or initiative being considered |
| target_customer | No | Who this is for (will be clarified if not provided) |
| problem | No | The problem being solved (will be articulated) |

## The Working Backwards Process

### Philosophy

Start with the customer experience and work backwards to the technology. If you cannot write a compelling press release that would excite customers, the idea is not ready. The act of writing forces clarity; ambiguity cannot hide in complete sentences.

### Step 1: Write the Press Release

The press release is 1-1.5 pages and follows this structure:

**Headline**
- Name the product
- State the primary customer benefit
- Should be compelling enough to make someone read more

**Subheading**
- Describe the target customer
- Expand on the benefit
- One sentence

**Summary Paragraph**
- Brief overview of product and benefit
- Written as if the product already exists
- Present tense, not future tense

**Problem Statement**
- Describe the problem being solved
- Make it concrete and specific
- Customer should recognize their pain

**Solution Description**
- How the product solves the problem
- Focus on the experience, not the technology
- What changes for the customer?

**Quote from Company Spokesperson**
- Why this matters
- Vision statement
- Should sound like something a real executive would say

**How to Get Started**
- Clear call to action
- Simple next step

**Customer Quote**
- Testimonial (even if imagined)
- Specific benefit experienced
- Emotional and practical elements

### Step 2: Write the External FAQ

Questions customers would ask:
- What is this?
- How does it work?
- How much does it cost?
- How is this different from [competitor/alternative]?
- What if I have problems?
- When is it available?

### Step 3: Write the Internal FAQ

Questions stakeholders would ask:
- What does this cost to build?
- How long will it take?
- What resources do we need?
- What are the key risks?
- How does this fit our strategy?
- What metrics define success?
- Why now?
- Why us?

### Step 4: Evaluate

**Kill the idea if:**
- The press release isn't compelling
- The problem statement is weak or generic
- The solution doesn't clearly address the problem
- Customer quote sounds forced or hollow
- Internal FAQ reveals fatal constraints

**Proceed if:**
- Press release would genuinely excite customers
- Problem is real and painful
- Solution clearly addresses the problem
- Internal FAQ concerns are manageable

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context

- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Working Backwards Analysis: FinanceAI

### Press Release

**HEADLINE:** FinanceAI Gives Small Business Owners Their Weekends Back

**SUBHEADING:** New AI assistant handles bookkeeping, invoicing, and financial reporting so entrepreneurs can focus on growing their business.

**SEATTLE, WA - January 2026** - FinanceAI today announced a new AI-powered financial assistant designed specifically for small business owners. The service automatically categorizes expenses, sends invoices, tracks payments, and generates financial reports - tasks that typically consume 8-10 hours per week for the average small business owner.

**The Problem:** Small business owners didn't start their business to do bookkeeping. Yet most spend one full day each week on financial administration - categorizing receipts, chasing invoices, reconciling accounts, and preparing reports for accountants. This administrative burden is the number one reason cited for entrepreneurial burnout.

**The Solution:** FinanceAI connects to your business bank accounts and automatically categorizes every transaction. It drafts and sends invoices based on your calendar and emails. It chases late payments so you don't have to. And at month-end, it generates the reports your accountant needs. Average time savings: 8 hours per week.

**"We built FinanceAI because we've seen too many great businesses fail not because of bad products, but because talented founders burned out on administrative work,"** said Sarah Chen, CEO of FinanceAI. **"Your bookkeeper shouldn't be the reason you miss your kid's soccer game."**

**Get Started:** Connect your business bank account at financeai.com. Your first month is free.

**"I used to spend every Sunday doing invoices and expenses. Now I spend Sundays with my family. FinanceAI paid for itself in the first week."** - Marcus Johnson, Owner, Johnson's Auto Repair

A: Yes. Bank-level encryption, SOC 2 compliance, and we never sell your data. We use read-only access to your bank accounts.

**Q: How is this different from QuickBooks?**

### Internal FAQ

**Q: What does this cost to build?**
A: MVP estimate: $2M over 12 months. Team of 8 (4 engineers, 2 ML specialists, 1 designer, 1 product manager).

**Q: What are the key risks?**
A: 1) Bank API reliability and costs. 2) Accuracy of auto-categorization must be >95% or users lose trust. 3) Regulatory compliance (varies by state).

**Q: How does this fit our strategy?**
A: Aligns with mission to reduce small business administrative burden. Natural extension of existing SMB tools.

**Q: What metrics define success?**
A: 1) Weekly active users. 2) Time saved per user (measured via survey). 3) Net Promoter Score. 4) Monthly recurring revenue.

**Q: Why now?**
A: LLM advances make conversational interface viable. Open banking APIs now available. Competitor landscape still fragmented.

---

### Recommendation

**Verdict:** PROCEED with refinement

**Reasoning:** Press release is compelling - "get your weekends back" resonates emotionally. Problem is real and painful (validated in customer research). Solution is specific and measurable (8 hours/week). Main risk is accuracy requirement - need to validate 95%+ accuracy is achievable before committing full resources.

**If proceeding, next steps:**
1. Technical spike on categorization accuracy with real bank data (2 weeks)
2. Customer interviews to validate problem severity and willingness to pay (1 week)
3. If accuracy >95% achievable and 8/10 customers say "I'd pay for this," greenlight MVP
